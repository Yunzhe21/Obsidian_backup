If $A$ is a trivial group, then $0_{A}=1_{A}$ is obvious.
Conversely, if $0_{A}=1_{A}$, then for every $x\in A$, $x=1_{A}x=0_{A}x=0_{A}$. ^d0aa6d

If $x,y\in A^{\times}$, then there exists $u,v\in A$ such that $xu=ux=1_{A}$ and $yv=vy=1_{A}$. Hence $(vu)(xy)=v(ux)y=vy=1_{A}$. Similarly with $(xy)(vu)=1_{A}$;
$\times$ is associative by definition;
Neutral element is $1_{A}$;
By definition of $A^{\times}$, every element has inverse. ^d86342
